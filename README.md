# Solar system model
 
Solar system model made in unity with gravity and calculated orbits based off orbital parameters. The model includes planet rendering based on realistic textures. This project was inspired by Sebastian Lague's work and showcases my skills in C# and Unity for both simulation and visual rendering.

## Usage

To use the solar system model, create a new GameObject in Unity for the system and attach the BodySimulation script to it. Add a system settings asset to the BodySimulation and configure the mass, initial position, and velocity of each body in the system. To display the orbits use the debug settings in the BodySimulation script.
